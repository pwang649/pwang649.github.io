Hi, Iâ€™m Qian Wang, but I go by Peter! I am a Junior at USC studying Computer Engineering and Computer Science and Applied Math. I am passionate about robotics and machine learning research. 

I am motivated by researching and developing new technologies, working to solve important problems, and learning new things every day. I enjoy understanding how things work and why. I like to see the big picture but also appreciate the small details. I am inspired by watching new ideas become new realities. I enjoy the challenges of building robust robotic systems that provide real-world value, finding new ways to apply cutting-edge research to today's problems, and working with teams of smart, passionate people.

## Bulletin

- Consider submitting to [International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems 2022](https://aamas2022-conference.auckland.ac.nz/).
- Learn reinforcement learning, optimization, and approximation algorithms.
- Learn Stanford's [CS223A - Introduction to Robotics](https://see.stanford.edu/course/cs223a) class.
- Add AI agent to project [PokerSC](projects).

## Research

I'm currently a research assistant at [Interactive and Collaborative Autonomous Robotic Systems (ICAROS) Lab](http://icaros.usc.edu/) Lab advised by [Dr. Stefanos Nikolaidis](https://stefanosnikolaidis.net/). My research focuses on learning and planning for multi-robot and human-robot systems and developing robotic systems for real-world problems. 

Last year, I worked on the design and control of a light-weight low-cost quadruped robot under the mentorship of [Dr. Quan Nyugen](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Nguyen/Quan) at the [Dynamic Robotics and Control Laboratory](https://sites.usc.edu/quann/) at USC. I co-lead the software control sub team and develop impedance and force control on the robot legs as well as developed and troubleshooted electrical hardware for the robot's 8-joint actuator system.

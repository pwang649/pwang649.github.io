Hi, Iâ€™m Qian Wang, but I go by Peter! I am a Senior at the University of Southern California (USC) studying Computer Engineering and Computer Science and Applied Math.

I am broadly interested in **robot planning** (long-horizon, manipulation, and multi-agent), particularly building agents that mimic human decision-making and act like humans. My research focuses on scalable methods that enable robots to perform complex, long-horizon tasks. So far, I have centered my research on developing better methods, both low-level search-based and high-level learning-based, to empower robots to accomplish fundamental and sophisticated tasks. Ultimately, I hope that robots and machines can be equipped with high-level cognitive skills to assist people in their daily lives and low-level motor skills to execute complex tasks effectively.

## Research

I am currently doing research with [Maxim Likhachev](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/maxim-likhachev/) at CMU working on 3D Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) and ML MAPF. 

I was fortunate to participate in several research projects in the past at USC. I worked on DNN-MCTS parallelization under the supervision of [Viktor Prasanna](https://sites.usc.edu/prasanna/). I worked on enhancing human-robot interaction using the Task and Motion Planning framework with the advisement of [Stefanos Nikolaidis](https://stefanosnikolaidis.net/) at the [ICAROS](http://icaros.usc.edu/) lab. I worked on the design and control of a lightweight low-cost quadruped robot under the mentorship of [Quan Nyugen](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Nguyen/Quan) at the [DRCL](https://sites.usc.edu/quann/) lab.

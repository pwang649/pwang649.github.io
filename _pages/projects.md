## Mini Quandruped Robot

We designed a small-scale, low-cost quadruped robotic platform with legs capable of 2 Degrees-of-Freedom movement, with a low-level control structure consisting of Raspberry Pi/CAN/Odrive and MATLAB/Simulink control

The purpose of this robot is to provide the research community with an open-source, fully developed quadruped robot platform that anyone with the necessary resources can reproduce. This mode would allow for further collaborative efforts between various external groups, and collective iteration on the platform itself. 

Partners: Albert Hu, Duc Phan
